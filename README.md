# singamajigs
This algorithm produces a score to perform a given melody on a number of
Sing-a-ma-jigs while optimizing for the smallest set of dolls needed.

```shell
python driver.py
```

Note it's in Python 2.7 'cause that's what was installed on my computer.

## What does this all even mean?
The Sing-a-ma-jigs were a line of singing toys. Each model had one public-domain
song that it sang one note of each time it was squeezed. A person could
theoretically use many Sing-a-ma-jigs to play a different melody of their
choosing. Imagine a handbell choir where every time you play a note that bell
will play a predictable but different note the next time. This algorithm
(assuming I can get it to work) outputs a score to play a song under those
constraints, while optimizing to minimize the number of Sing-a-ma-jigs (bells)
needed.

## Why?
Because they're obnoxious. Also because I saw videos like
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1a554_J9VU) and thought to myself
"this person had to do so much planning, and keeping track of the notes each
doll makes, and I should make it easy for future generations to do this." And
because it's an interesting coding exercise and I need to get more comfortable
in Python.

A big thanks to the YouTube channel

clear videos of each Sing-a-ma-jig's song.

not to infringe on their rights in this project. I believe all of the songs
they perform are in the Public Domain but if I've posted something I shouldn't
have, please let me know so I can remove it.
